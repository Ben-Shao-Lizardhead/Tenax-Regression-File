# Tenax-Regression-File
Rmd file for regression analysis on Tenax vs organism.

One merged analysis done so far is incorrect due to multiple reasons.
Merge all datasets into one and attempt to find one regression.
This is not done correctly since some of the variable have very unbalanced sample size between different levels.
Some of the variables are linearly correlated.
The planar assignment is done incorrectly, but not shown in the final regression model.
